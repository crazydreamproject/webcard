  Returns a Parser object of the following structure:

  Parser: {
    yy: {}
  }

  Parser.prototype: {
    yy: {},
    trace: function(),
    symbols_: {associative list: name ==> number},
    terminals_: {associative list: number ==> name},
    productions_: [...],
    performAction: function anonymous(yytext, yyleng, yylineno, yy, yystate, $$, _$),
    table: [...],
    defaultActions: {...},
    parseError: function(str, hash),
    parse: function(input),

    lexer: {
        EOF: 1,
        parseError: function(str, hash),
        setInput: function(input),
        input: function(),
        unput: function(str),
        more: function(),
        less: function(n),
        pastInput: function(),
        upcomingInput: function(),
        showPosition: function(),

        next: function(),
        lex: function(),
        begin: function(condition),
        popState: function(),
        _currentRules: function(),
        topState: function(),
        pushState: function(condition),

        options: {
            ranges: boolean           (optional: true ==> token location info will include a .range[] member)
            flex: boolean             (optional: true ==> flex-like lexing behaviour where the rules are tested exhaustively to find the longest match)
            backtrack_lexer: boolean  (optional: true ==> lexer regexes are tested in order and for each matching regex the action code is invoked; the lexer terminates the scan when a token is returned by the action code)
        },

        performAction: function(yy, yy_, $avoiding_name_collisions, YY_START),
        rules: [...],
        conditions: {associative list: name ==> set},
    }
  }


  token location info (@$, _$, etc.): {
    first_line: n,
    last_line: n,
    first_column: n,
    last_column: n,
    range: [start_number, end_number]       (where the numbers are indexes into the input string, regular zero-based)
  }


  the parseError function receives a 'hash' object with these members for lexer and parser errors: {
    text:        (matched text)
    token:       (the produced terminal token, if any)
    line:        (yylineno)
  }
  while parser (grammar) errors will also provide these members, i.e. parser errors deliver a superset of attributes: {
    loc:         (yylloc)
    expected:    (string describing the set of expected tokens)
    recoverable: (boolean: TRUE when the parser has a error recovery rule available for this particular error)
  }
